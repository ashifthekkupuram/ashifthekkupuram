## 🧗 Coding Journey

My name is Ashif Hussain C H. I embarked on my coding journey with a curious mind, initially experimenting with Python to create Discord bots. Along the way, I explored Flutter but paused my journey midway. Realizing the potential in web development, I delved into the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Eager to expand my skills, I immersed myself in Django and Django Rest Framework for backend development. However, I decided to stop trying Django with React. Instead, I started learning the MERN stack to stick with one language throughout the stack. Currently, I am honing my expertise in the MERN stack, aiming to become a proficient full-stack developer with React powering my frontend, Node.js with Express driving my backend, and MongoDB as my database. Passionate about leveraging technology to solve real-world problems, I am dedicated to continuous learning and growth in the dynamic field of software development.
